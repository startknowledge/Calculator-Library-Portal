<p>Big O notation is a mathematical concept used in computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It provides an upper bound on the time or space required by an algorithm as the input size grows.</p>
<p>Common Big O notations include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>O(1)</b>: Constant time complexity, where the execution time does not change with input size.</li>
  <li><b>O(log n)</b>: Logarithmic time complexity, where the execution time grows logarithmically with input size.</li>
  <li><b>O(n)</b>: Linear time complexity, where the execution time grows linearly with input size.</li>
  <li><b>O(n log n)</b>: Linearithmic time complexity, common in efficient sorting algorithms.</li>
  <li><b>O(n²)</b>: Quadratic time complexity, where the execution time grows quadratically with input size.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a simple loop that iterates through an array of size n has a time complexity of O(n), while a binary search algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n).</p>
<p>Understanding Big O notation helps developers analyze and optimize algorithms for better performance.</p>
