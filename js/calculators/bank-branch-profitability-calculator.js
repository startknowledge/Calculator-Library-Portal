    <p><u>Explanation about Bank Branch Profitability Calculation</u> :</p>
    <p>The profitability of a bank branch is determined by calculating the net profit, which is the difference between the total income generated by the branch and the total expenses incurred in its operation. This calculation helps in assessing the financial health and performance of the branch.</p>
    <p>The formula to calculate net profit is as follows:</p>
    <p><b>Net Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses</b></p>
    <p>For example, if a bank branch has a total income of ₹500,000 and total expenses of ₹300,000, the net profit would be calculated as follows:</p>
    <p>Net Profit = ₹500,000 - ₹300,000 = ₹200,000</p>
    <p>A positive net profit indicates that the branch is profitable, while a negative net profit suggests that the branch is operating at a loss. Regularly monitoring the profitability of bank branches is essential for making informed business decisions and implementing strategies to improve financial performance.</p>
